# How to promote involvement and participation in environmental monitoring to minimize data gaps?

## Description

Citizen Observatories are community-based initiatives where non-experts actively participate in data collection and monitoring of various phenomena, such as environmental challenges as air pollution. Citizen Observatories rely on the collective efforts of people who voluntarily offer their time to gather valuable data (in some cases, participants can receive a monetary counterpart). A challenge usually encountered in Citizen Observatories is data gaps. Those can be temporal data gaps, referring to time series that are not complete in time, or spatial data gaps, referring to lack of data in specific locations. Reducing data gaps in citizen observations can be achieved through various strategies that promote active involvement and participation.

## Why is this relevant?

Data gaps and incomplete data limit the utility of the data, as well as our ability to make informed decisions. Without comprehensive data, decisions may be based on biased data. In scientific research, data gaps can limit the scope of studies. Researchers rely on comprehensive data to test hypotheses and draw meaningful conclusions. Moreover, data gaps can perpetuate existing social inequalities. Without data on marginalized or underrepresented communities, these groups may be overlooked in policymaking and resource allocation, exacerbating social disparities and missing opportunities for positive impact.

## How can this be done?

List of approaches to encourage citizens to contribute with valuable data and minimize data gaps:

1. **Set clear goals, protocols and communicate them:**
   1. Raise awareness about the importance of observations and their impact on scientific research, decision-making processes and, most importantly for the community: what is in it for them.
   2. Conduct workshops, seminars, and public awareness campaigns to communicate the objectives, methods, and the benefits of the collected data.
   3. Involve participants in the definition of the goals, that will increase agency, create ownership, and increase the understanding on how the outcomes can have a positive impact in the community.
2. **Choose user-friendly technology and offer support and training:**
   1. Use/Develop user-friendly mobile apps, online platforms, sensing devices that simplify data collected and submission processes.
   2. Ensure that the technology is accessible to people with varying levels of technical expertise, making it easy for anyone to participate.
   3. Provide training sessions and resources to help participants understand the scientific protocols, data collection methods, and the significance of their contributions. Adapt the language to the audience.
   4. Offer ongoing support through helplines, forums, and community moderators to address questions and issues faced by participants.
   5. Offer regular meetings. Those are important to progressively build on top of previous training and to create dynamic amongst the group. It may be complicated to have all participants at the same time so creating subgroups or having virtual meetings can be a nice way to adapt to their schedule and ensure maximum participation.
   6. Be there when participants need you. Not all the questions will be asked during formal meetings. Provide online support through a forum with FAQ and ideally start a dedicated WhatsApp group (or alike) after making sure you have all user's consent.
3. **Keep the Community Engaged:**
   1. Organize community events, Citizen Science festivals and meetups to foster a sense of community and belonging.
   2. Identify local community leaders and influencers and encourage them to promote the Citizen Observatory within their networks.
   3. Conduct targeted engagement, ensuring you engage with participants in the areas where data is needed.
   4. Gamification and competition are also a good way to stimulate engagement among the group. Protocols and nudges are also key to creating a framework where participants know what is expected of them, at what moment, for what reasons and for how long.
4. **Increase acceptance of the collected data by applying data quality assurance and transparency through open data:**
   1. Implement quality control measures to validate citizen-contributed data, ensuring its accuracy and reliability.
   2. Provide training on proper data collection and metadata documentation to enhance the quality and uptake of the observations.
   3. Communicate the data quality expectations, especially when using sensing devices that have large uncertainties.
   4. Foster a culture of transparency by openly sharing collected data, methodologies and research findings with participants and the wider public.
   5. Encourage participants to access and use open data for their own analyses and project.
   6. Provide friendly tools for data analysis so that communities can do their own research.
5. **Feedback and Recognition:**
   1. Provide regular feedback to participants about the impact of their contributions and the outcomes of the Citizen Science projects.
   2. Recognize and appreciate the efforts of participants through certificates, awards, or other forms of acknowledgement.
   3. Remember that communication goes both ways, and the participants need to be listened to.
6. **Inclusivity and Diversity:**
   1. Ensure inclusivity by reaching out to diverse communities, including underrepresented groups, and making efforts to involve people from different backgrounds, cultures, and ages.
7. **Collaboration and Partnerships:**
   1. Collaborate with local organizations, schools, NGOs and research institutions to expand the reach of the initiative.

## Useful resources

Here are some useful resources that can help in the endeavor of reducing data gaps in citizen observations and promoting active involvement:

* [Miro boards](https://miro.com/) and [Mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/) are great example of tools to collect structured feedback in a participative, fun and structured way. There are other similar tools.
* European Citizen Science Association (ECSA): ECSA provides resources and publications related to Citizen Science, including guidelines for project organizers, policy recommendations, and research papers that can inform the design of Citizen Science initiatives.

* Citizen Science Toolkit by Earthwatch Institute: This Toolkit provides guides, templates, and resources for organizing successful Citizen Science projects. It covers project planning, data collection, and community engagement strategies. Website: [Earthwatch Institute](https://earthwatch.org/)
* Public Lab: Public Lab is a community-driven research organization that provides open-source tools and resources for environmental exploration and documentation. They offer guides on DIY environmental monitoring and Citizen Science techniques. Website: [Public Lab](https://publiclab.org/)
* WeObserve Toolkit: A collection of tools are free resources that new and existing Citizen Science and Citizen Observatory projects can use to assist their activities. The resources are classified in four categories’: Co-designing / co-creating your observatory; Training & data collection for environmental monitoring; Data quality and visualisation; and Evaluation and advocacy.
