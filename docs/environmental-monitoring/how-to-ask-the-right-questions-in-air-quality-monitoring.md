# How to ask the right questions in air quality monitoring?

## Description

Asking the right questions in environmental monitoring is a crucial step before delving into practical tasks. This is key to identify our research questions and define a clear set of goals. The questions that we ask will impact the methodology and processes we will follow, for instance: how and when to measure, and how many and what type of sensors we need. This section will describe how to go through this reflection process and help us formulate the research question.

## Why is this relevant?

Asking the right research questions will define a great portion of our sensing journey, as it will help us understand what the most suitable tools for our purpose are and how to make the best use of them. It will also help us understand who we may be interested in collaborating with and seek collaboration in other groups. Further down the line, this step will help to be mindful of the resources at hand —financial, technical, and human. By having clear questions in mind, we can adapt our work so that it be can realistically achieved within these constraints and will help us work towards our goals.

## How can this be done?

A good way to start is addressing the question: what are we worried about? Although the question might look simple at first sight, it involves the development of an understanding of the issue or issues at hand. Next, once we have identified “what we are worried about”, we would like to convert those concerns into a research question and testable hypotheses. This can be done by translating our concerns to simple and manageable questions, such as: how does car traffic affect air quality in my neighbourhood? or, is noise pollution worse on weekdays or weekends? Simple and clear questions will allow us to design a methodology to collect data that can answer those questions. Otherwise, we risk started collecting data, and find at the end that we have not collected the right data to design actions to address “what we are worried about”.

The considerations below can help to formulate the research question:

1. **Identify the purpose:** understand the specific objectives of the air quality monitoring effort. Are you trying to assess compliance with air quality standards, investigate the sources of pollution, or evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation measures? Tailor your questions to align with these objectives.
2. **Define key parameters:** determine which air pollutants are of primary concern based on local regulations, health impacts, and environmental significance. Ask questions that focus on monitoring these key parameters, such as particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
3. **Consider sources and pathways:** understand the sources and pathways of air pollution in the monitoring area. Ask questions about nearby industrial activities, transportation patterns, natural sources (e.g., wildfires), and indoor sources (e.g., cooking, cleaning) that may contribute to air pollution.
4. **Assess exposure and vulnerability:** consider who may be most affected by poor air quality and where exposure is highest. Ask questions about sensitive populations (e.g., children, elderly, individuals with respiratory conditions) and vulnerable areas (e.g., near highways, industrial facilities, or disadvantaged communities).
5. **Evaluate spatial and temporal variability:** recognize that air quality can vary spatially and temporally due to factors such as topography, meteorology, and human activities. Ask questions about the spatial distribution of pollutants, seasonal trends, diurnal patterns, and potential hotspots of pollution.
6. **Explore mitigation strategies:** inquire about existing or potential mitigation strategies to improve air quality. Ask questions about emission reduction measures, land-use planning, transportation policies, and public health interventions aimed at reducing exposure to air pollution and protecting public health.
7. **Map stakeholders that can be engaged:** involve relevant stakeholders in the process of formulating questions to ensure that their perspectives and concerns are addressed. Collaborate with government agencies, community groups, industry representatives, and academic experts to develop a comprehensive list of questions that reflect diverse interests and priorities. You can use existing tools for stakeholder mapping to identify “who we may be able to work with”.
8. **Allocate adequate resources including personnel, equipment, and funding:** environmental monitoring requires sufficient resources to be effective. Ensure you have the necessary personnel trained in monitoring techniques, access to appropriate equipment and technology for data collection, and adequate funding to support ongoing monitoring activities. Refine your questions to find a balance between what you want to do and what you can do with the resources available. You can also identify stakeholders who might support your work.

## Useful resources

* [European Environmental Agency](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en) (EEA): provides extensive resources on air quality monitoring, including guidance documents, technical reports, and interactive tools. Their website offers information on air pollutants, monitoring methods, data interpretation, and regulatory requirements.
* [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/what-are-the-who-air-quality-guidelines) (WHO): The WHO offers guidance on air quality management, including methodologies for assessing health risks, setting air quality guidelines, and implementing monitoring programs. Their publications provide valuable insights into the health impacts of air pollution and strategies for mitigating risks.
* Participatory Mapping Tools: Participatory Mapping Tools, such as Community Mapping, Geographic Information Systems, and Participatory Geographic Information Systems, facilitate collaborative stakeholder engagement by allowing communities to map their resources, concerns, and priorities. Example of participatory mapping: [Mapping for Rights](https://www.mappingforrights.org/participatory-mapping/).
