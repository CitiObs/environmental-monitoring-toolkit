# Who is who in air quality environmental monitoring?

## Description

Environmental monitoring in general, and air quality monitoring in particular, involves multiple actors and stakeholders. Depending on the nature of your organization or project, the nature of your issues and the country where you are based, your ideal interlocutor may be different.

## Why is this relevant?

Knowing who is who in environmental monitoring is crucial for Citizen Science initiatives as it enables the identification of key stakeholders, fosters collaborative partnerships, accesses local knowledge and expertise, enhances data quality and credibility, increases community engagement and ownership, supports advocacy and action, and fosters environmental education and awareness. By involving diverse stakeholders in the monitoring process, Citizen Science initiatives can benefit from the expertise and insights of community members, build trust and transparency, and empower communities to address environmental challenges collectively. This approach not only strengthens the scientific rigor and relevance of the monitoring efforts but also promotes environmental stewardship and positive change at the local level.

## How can this be done?

To include the right stakeholders in a project, you need to figure out who the potential partners are, and what their contribution may be. This will change depending on your research question, and also on your city and country.

Below is a list of typical actors and their roles:

1. [**European Environmental Agency**](https://www.eea.europa.eu/en/topics/in-depth/air-pollution) **(EEA):** countries that are part of the European Union must comply with European Air Quality directives and must report their environmental data to the EEA. The EEA provides information about the state of the environment for all countries in the EU and the health effects.
2. [**The World Health Organization**](https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/what-are-the-who-air-quality-guidelines) **(WHO)** provides Global Air Quality Guidelines based on the health effects of the pollutants. The European Air Quality Directives are based on the WHO guidelines but are usually less ambitious.
3. **Governments:** governments at the local, regional, and national levels play a crucial role in (air quality) policy making. They are usually in charge of implementing measures for protecting the health of humans and the environment. In the European Union (EU), they need to align with the air quality regulations approved at EU level, such as, for example, the Air Quality Directive. Some governments, on the local scale, are more ambitious than just complying with European regulations.
4. **Environmental Protection Agencies:** Environmental protection agencies are specialized government agencies that are responsible for monitoring air quality. They work for governments. They collaborate with research institutions to assess and develop policies and advise governments in their programs to improve air quality. Some agencies are more open to Citizen Science than others. In the Netherlands and Flanders for example, the environmental agencies actively support Citizen Science data.
5. **Research Institutions:** research institutions, such as universities and scientific organizations, conduct studies and research on air quality. They develop new monitoring technologies, analyze air pollution data, and provide scientific insights into the causes and impacts of air pollution. More and more of these institutes see Citizen Science as a useful method to do research and engage with society.
6. **Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs):** NGOs play a vital role in raising awareness about air pollution issues and advocating for improved air quality. They often work on community-based monitoring initiatives, engage in public education campaigns, and advocate for stronger environmental regulations.
7. **Citizen Observatories:** Citizen Observatories (COs) are groups of individuals who actively participate in air quality monitoring initiatives. They collect data (for example using sensing devices or mobile applications), raise awareness about air pollution in their communities, and aim that the data collected can be used by (local) governments in policymaking. Citizen Observatories often involve the collaboration between citizens, NGOs, research institutions, (local) governments, etc. See for example the [WeObserve project](https://www.weobserve.eu/), with resources and meeting places for Citizen Observatories.
8. [**Fablab network**](https://www.fablabs.io/)**:** A fablab, short for "fabrication laboratory," is a small-scale workshop equipped with digital fabrication tools and technologies for personal and collaborative projects. Fablabs typically offer access to a range of equipment such as 3D printers, laser cutters, CNC machines, electronics prototyping tools, and computer-controlled machining equipment. They provide a shared space where individuals from diverse backgrounds, including students, hobbyists, entrepreneurs, and professionals, can come together to design, create, and innovate. Fablabs promote hands-on learning, experimentation, and skill-building in areas like digital design, fabrication, and rapid prototyping, fostering creativity and entrepreneurship within local communities. These spaces often emphasize open access, knowledge sharing, and collaboration, serving as hubs for innovation and grassroots manufacturing.
9. **Communities of Practice (CoP):** CoPs are groups of people who share a common interest, expertise, or passion for a particular topic or domain and come together to learn, collaborate, and share knowledge and experiences. CoPs are characterized by their informal nature, where members engage in regular interactions, discussions, and activities to deepen their understanding and expertise in the shared domain. Some examples are the ones hosted by the European Citizen Science Association ([Working Groups](https://www.ecsa.ngo/working-groups/)) and the [WeObserve project](https://www.weobserve.eu/cops/).
10. **The Copernicus Programme:** Copernicus is the EU’s flagship Earth observation programme dedicated to monitoring of the Earth and its environment. A core aim of this programme is to provide data and services that are free for all to use and are for the betterment of all European citizens. Copernicus consists of three components that are of relevance to air quality monitoring:
    1. The satellite-based **Copernicus space component.** This component consists of a series of satellites, dubbed the Sentinels (numbered 1-6), that were specifically designed to support the Copernicus programme with each satellite having a different focus on different aspects of the the Earth’s environment. Sentinel-5P and the planned Sentinel-4 and Sentinel-5 satellite instruments are of most relevance for air quality with their ability to observe nitrogen dioxide and other pollutants. In addition to the Sentinel satellite series, there is a much larger number (20+) of European (managed by either ESA or EUMETSAT) satellites that are considered to contribute to the Copernicus space component.
    2. The **Copernicus in-situ component**
    3. The **Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Services CAMS** provides a variety of operational services that are used to support air quality monitoring at national and regional levels across Europe. These services are in the form of air quality forecasts and products called analyses and reanalyses that combine ground and space-based observations with modelling output to better enhance the model forecasts. In addition to these air quality forecasting services, CAMS provides a set of tools to help policymakers and air quality experts understand the causes of air pollution across Europe and in specific cities. Furthermore, CAMS provides annual reports summarizing the air quality situation across Europe each year.
