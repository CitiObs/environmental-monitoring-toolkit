### Submitting via GitHub / email

*   **I'm submitting a …**&#x20;

    This is the category of your feedback. You need to choose whether you are reporting a problem you found or requesting that new content be added. This helps the team understand the fundamental nature of your submission right away.
*   **problem report**

    You found something that isn't working correctly, is confusing, or seems wrong.
*   **new content request**&#x20;

    You think something is missing or could be added to make the toolkit better.
*   **What is the current behavior?**&#x20;

    This is where you describe the situation as it is now.

    * If you are submitting a problem report, you should explain what you are currently seeing or experiencing that is incorrect or problematic.
    * If the current behaviour is a problem, please provide the details of where you found it (which page and section). This is crucial for problem reports as it helps the team locate the exact part of the toolkit you are referring to.
*   **What would you improve?**

    This is where you propose your solution or suggestion. You explain what you think should be changed or added.
*   **What is the motivation / use case for changing the behavior?**

    This explains why your suggestion is important or how it would be used. This provides context for your feedback and helps the team understand the benefit of implementing your proposed change or adding the new content.
*   **Other information**

    This is a space for any additional details that might be relevant but don't fit neatly into the categories above.

In essence, this template provides a structured way for users – whether they are scientists using the methodological sections or creatives engaging with the collaboration guidance – to clearly communicate issues or suggest improvements to the _CitiObs Community-led Action Toolkit_. It ensures that all necessary information is provided for the feedback to be effectively reviewed and potentially incorporated into future versions of the toolkit.

### Contributions

The easiest way to contribute is via a GitHub issue and, if you can, a Pull request. This process can be scary at first, but it's the way it's done in the _open source_ community.
