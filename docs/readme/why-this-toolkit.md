# Why this Toolkit?

Citizen Observatories (COs) involve citizens using modern mobile and web technologies and/or sensors to collect and share data, which enhance Earth Observation systems and official data sources by filling in gaps and adding detail. Often using dedicated IT infrastructure, COs support the flow of data and information between citizens, scientists, and decision-makers, and typically have a distinct focus on influencing decision-making, policy change, and/or environmental governance outcomes.

We have seen that data collected in Citizen Science and COs initiatives are often not regarded as trustful data when it is communicated to decision makers. We have also seen that COs for environmental monitoring tend to engage with participants that feel attracted to technology, leaving behind participants that feel not at ease when it comes to the use of novel technologies. The Toolkit aims to provide guidance to avoid or reduce the technological barriers hindering the widespread adoption of sensing devices and other monitoring systems.
