| **Sensing Device / Low-cost sensor device**       | A Sensing Device refers to a compact electronic device that uses one or more than one sensor and other electronic components to detect, monitor, and/or report on specific environmental parameters or phenomena at a relatively affordable price. These sensing devices are often built using economical components and simplified designs, making them accessible to a wide range of users, including citizen scientists, educators, and community groups. Despite their lower cost, they are engineered to provide reasonably accurate measurements, allowing for meaningful data collection and analysis. Sensing devices play a vital role in democratising scientific research, enabling individuals and communities to monitor and understand their local environment, address environmental concerns, and contribute to scientific knowledge and public policy decisions. In this document we mostly refer to Sensing Devices to monitor air pollution. During the creation of this document, we decided to adopt the terminology Sensing Device, to avoid detrimental connotations that can be associated with the term “low-cost”, as for example, of worse quality. However, the term low-cost sensor is still widely recognised and used by the Citizen Science and the academic community. |
| **Open science**                                  | UNESCO defines Open Science as a set of principles and practices that aim to make scientific research from all fields accessible to everyone for the benefits of scientists and society. Open science is about making sure not only that scientific knowledge is accessible but also that the production of that knowledge itself is inclusive, equitable and sustainable. Open science advocates for transparency, accessibility and reproducibility, principles that have a larger potential of benefiting society. The use of open source and open science can contribute to increase acceptance of data in science and policy, as it moves away from black boxes and unknown proprietary algorithms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Free and open source (FOSS)**                   | FOSS refers to groups of technology that are licensed to freely use, copy, study, and modify in any way, without charge. Here the word ‘free’ is used in the sense of ‘free speech’, not ‘free beer’ (Richard Stallman, GNU 2011).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Open Source**                                   | Open source refers to making the underlying [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code) or designs of a technology publicly available so that people are encouraged to re-use, re-purpose, or improve the design. This is in contrast to [proprietary software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software), or hardware designs where the technology is under restrictive [copyright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright) or [licensing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_license) and the source code or designs are hidden from the users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Metadata**                                      | Metadata refers to descriptive information that provides context, structure, and meaning to data. It serves as a set of data about data, encompassing details such as the origin, format, content, and usage of a dataset or individual data elements. Metadata helps users understand and interpret data by providing essential attributes and properties, such as creation date, authorship, location, and data quality indicators. It facilitates data discovery, organisation, retrieval, and management, enabling efficient data integration, sharing, and analysis across different systems, platforms, and domains. Metadata plays a crucial role in data governance, data management, and data-driven decision-making processes, ensuring the reliability, accuracy, and usability of data assets throughout their lifecycle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Provenance**                                    | Data provenance refers to the documentation of the origin, history, and transformations applied to a piece of data throughout its lifecycle.
