# About

This toolkit is part of the **CitiObs** project.

CitiObs (_Enhancing Citizen Observatories for healthy, sustainable, resilient and inclusive cities_) is a EU Project aimed at fostering inclusive, diverse, and stable citizen participation in the observation, monitoring, and protection of urban environments. Through the use of low-cost sensor technologies and wearables, CitiObs supports the observation of air quality and other environmental measures, empowering citizens to take an active role in shaping sustainable urban policies.
