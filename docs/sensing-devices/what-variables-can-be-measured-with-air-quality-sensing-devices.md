# What variables can be measured with air quality sensing devices?

## Description

Air quality sensing device can measure various air pollution variables, though the specific parameters they can monitor may vary depending on the sensor type and design. Sensing device technologies can be deployed for monitoring both outdoor and indoor air quality, allowing for localized assessments of pollution levels in various environments such as homes, workplaces, schools, and public spaces. Depending on our objective, we need to ensure to select a sensing device that monitors the pollutants that are the most relevant. For example, if we want to monitor pollution from traffic NO2 and PM10 are very relevant parameters, while for wood burning, PM2.5 shall be monitored. It is also important to mention that not all sensing devices are at the same maturity level. Some sensors in the market cannot be used “out of the box” as they require specific calibrations in scientific laboratories and special co-location and calibration against reference instrumentation. More information on calibration is available in: “What is data quality? How can we increase data quality in citizen gathered data?”

## Why is this relevant?

Not all sensing devices available on the market are designed to measure the same parameters. Therefore, it is crucial to begin by clearly defining our objectives and the specific questions we aim to address. Next, we must identify the most significant pollutants relevant to our goals and ensure that the selected sensing device can measure those pollutants accurately. It's important to recognize that the quality and precision of measurements depend on the maturity of the sensing element and its integration into the sensing device. Whenever possible, it's advisable to seek information on whether others have tested the sensing device against reference instrumentation. This evaluation can help determine if the desired variable can be measured with sufficient quality and accuracy for our intended purposes.

## How can this be done?

Some common air pollution variables that can be measured with sensing devices technologies include:

1. **Particulate Matter (PM):** sensors can measure particulate matter concentrations in the air, typically categorized by size fractions such as PM₁₀ (particles with a diameter of 10 micrometers or less) or PM2.5 (particles with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less).
2. **Gases (chemical composition):** sensors may detect various gases associated with air pollution, including nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), ozone (O₃), sulfur dioxide (SO₂), carbon monoxide (CO), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and hydrogen sulfide (H₂S).
3. **Environmental metrics:** most air quality sensors include meteorological sensors to measure barometric pressure, temperature and humidity levels, which can provide context for interpreting air pollution data and understanding atmospheric conditions.
