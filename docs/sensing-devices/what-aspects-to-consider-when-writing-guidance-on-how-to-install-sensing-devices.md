# What aspects to consider when writing guidance on how to install sensing devices?

## Description

Sometimes, even if the device manufacturer provides instructions on how to do the installation, those might not meet the needs of the users (language is too technical, need of translation to local language, etc.).

## Why is this relevant?

When writing guidance on how to install sensing devices, it’s important to provide clear and comprehensive instructions to ensure the installation is done correctly, minimizing the risk of data loss, and putting in place protocols to help ensuring data quality.

## How can this be done?

Some of the aspects that need to be considered to ensure individuals and organizations conduct a correct installation are the following:

1. **Preparation:**
   1. Begin with a section on pre-installation preparations, including a checklist of items needed.
   2. Specify any tools required for the installation process.
   3. Specify safety procedures for the installation.
2. **Site selection:**
   1. Provide criteria for selecting suitable monitoring locations.
   2. Consider factors such as proximity to pollution sources, wind direction, elevation and representativeness of the area.
3. **Sensor placement:**
   1. Clearly describe where to place the sensor for optimal data collection.
   2. Include information on the ideal height and orientation of the device.
   3. Provide information on what to do when the ideal conditions cannot be met.
   4. Include examples of what will be non-correct device placement that might cause wrong data readings.
4. **Weather considerations:**
   1. Recommend weatherproof enclosures if necessary.
   2. Discuss how to protect the device from adverse weather conditions (e.g. rain, snow, extreme temperatures).
5. **Calibration instructions:**
   1. Outline step-by-step procedures for calibrating/checking the device before installation.
   2. Include information on how often calibration/checking should be performed.
6. **Power supply:**
   1. Specify power requirements for the device and provide guidance on connecting to a stable power source.
   2. Include information if the device should be connected indoors or can be connected to an outdoor power supply.
   3. Include information on battery replacement or recharging if applicable.
   4. Include information on expected power consumption.
7. **Connectivity instructions:**
   1. Explain how to set up and test the devices’ connectivity to networks (e.g. Wi-Fi, cellular).
   2. Include troubleshooting tips for connectivity issues.
   3. Include expected amount of data transmission.
8. **Data storage and transmission:**
   1. Detail how the device stores and transmits data.
   2. Provide instructions for setting up data storage solutions and configuring data transmission methods, if applicable.
   3. Detail how to access, visualize and download the data.
9. **Device type and pollutants:**
   1. Specify the type of device being installed and the pollutants it is designed to measure.
   2. Provide information on the detection limits, accuracy and precision of the sensor.
10. **Maintenance guidelines:**
    1. Outline routine maintenance procedures, including cleaning and sensor replacement.
    2. Include a maintenance schedule to ensure ongoing reliability.
11. **Security measures:**
    1. Include recommendations for securing the device against tampering or vandalism.
    2. Provide guidance on data security measures, such as encryption.
    3. Provide a description of what type of data will be made open and visible to other people.
12. **Data licensing and usage policies:**
    1. Clearly specify the licensing and usage policies associated with the data. Define how the data can be used, shared and attributed, ensuring transparency in terms of data ownership and usage rights.
13. **Transparency in data processing:**
    1. Be transparent about data processing methods and algorithms. Clearly communicate how data is processed and analyzed. Ensure transparency in the entire data lifecycle.
14. **Data privacy and ethics:**
    1. Explain how you adhere to ethical guidelines and principles, especially concerning data privacy and confidentiality. Clearly communicate the measures taken to protect sensitive information, ensuring transparency in how participant privacy is respected and maintained.
15. **Data validation and quality control:**
    1. Explain how the data is being validated and corrected.
    2. Explain procedures for recognized anomalies or errors in the data and how to deal with them.
16. **Troubleshooting:**
    1. Include a troubleshooting section with common issues and their solutions.
    2. Provide contact information for technical support, if needed.
17. **Documentation:**
    1. Encourage thorough documentation of the installation, including photos and notes.
    2. Include templates for recording installation details for future reference.
    3. Provide instructions on how to report metadata and complementary documentation.
18. **Recycling:**
    1. Provide information about recycling or disposal recommendations.
    2. Provide information on repurposing. For example, if the air quality sensing device is still in working condition, consider donating it to educational institutions or community groups.
    3. Provide information on secure data disposal if the device stores data, ensuring that any sensitive information is securely wiped before recycling to protect privacy.
19. **Accessibility:**
    1. Ensure color contrast. Use high color contrast for text and background elements to improve readability, especially for individuals with visual impairments.
    2. Use images and photos to illustrate the installation procedure.
20. **Clear and simple language:**
    1. Communicate in plain language, avoiding unnecessary jargon.
    2. Define technical terms or provide a glossary to help readers understand complex terms.
21. **Translation:**
    1. Provide translation of the installation guidelines.
    2. Ensure the translation is accurate.
