# What are the main aspects you need to consider when managing citizen collected data?

## Description

Data management in the context of sensor data involves ensuring its accuracy, reliability, accessibility, and usability. It includes more technical aspects such as data quality, processing, storage, and visualization, but it also covers concerns such as privacy and ethics, transparency, and questions around data ownership, licensing, and legal compliance.

In a perspective of community projects or collaboration with stakeholders in policy making process, data collected by Citizen Observatories is more than just data. It is the result of the engagement of the community, a common heritage, a digital testimony of the state of the environment and the foundation on top of which discussions, consensus and actions will be built upon.

## Why is this relevant?

Data collected within the realm of Citizen Science is frequently disregarded due to perceptions of lower reliability compared to data gathered through more scientific and official means. Nonetheless, by addressing the limitations inherent in citizen-collected data utilizing sensing devices, such data can serve to complement traditional monitoring methods, offering significant insights crucial for informed decision-making and proactive measures.

## How can this be done?

Data management involves a series of processes aimed at ensuring the accuracy, reliability, accessibility, and usability of the collected data. Here’s an overview of the key aspects of data management in this context:

1. **Data collection:** once selected, sensing devices should be deployed and used through protocols established to ensure that data is collected through a structured process to meet pre-defined quality standards.
2. **Data quality assurance:** ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the collected data is essential. Quality assurance measures include sensor calibration, regular maintenance, and validation against reference instruments or established monitoring stations. Data validation techniques help identify and correct errors or inconsistencies in the dataset.
3. **Contextualization:** context provides the basis for interpretation, helping you understand what the data means and therefore what you can do, or cannot do with it. Contextualization involves providing additional details surrounding the data, such as the circumstances of collection, environmental conditions, and relevant factors influencing interpretation.
4. **Data processing and analysis:** processing raw sensor data into meaningful information involves various steps such as data filtering, aggregation, interpolation, and statistical analysis. Data analysis techniques help identify trends, patterns, correlations, and anomalies in the dataset, providing for instance insights into air quality dynamics and pollution sources.
5. **Traceability:** when managing data, much attention should be paid to traceability issues, from documenting data origins to cover privacy and licensing issues, to bug tracking to identify concerned datasets in the case of a faulty device for example, but also to have a clear understanding of the processing that were applied to the data. Linked to data quality, traceability is a pillar in data trust.
6. **Data visualization:** presenting air quality data in visually appealing and understandable formats enhances data interpretation and communication. Graphs, charts, maps, and interactive dashboards are commonly used to visualize key metrics, trends, and spatial distributions of pollutants.
7. **Transparency and accessibility:** making air quality data and analysis accessible to stakeholders, including policymakers, researchers, public health officials, and the general public, promotes transparency and collaboration. Open data portals, APIs, and web-based platforms facilitate data sharing and enable users to access and download the data for analysis or read the outcomes of the analysis.
8. **Privacy and ethical considerations:** protecting sensitive information and ensuring data privacy are important considerations, particularly when collecting data from personal devices or citizen volunteers. Adhering to privacy regulations and obtaining informed consent from participants is essential to maintain trust and ethical integrity in data management practices.
9. **Licensing considerations:** define licensing terms and conditions associated with the data to ensure legal compliance, protect intellectual property rights and facilitate appropriate data sharing and reuse.
10. **Long-term data preservation:** develop strategies for long-term data preservation to ensure the sustainability and usability of air quality datasets for future research, monitoring and policy-making efforts.
